# The Idea

At the beginning of this year, me & my dad started investing some money in stocks using the [Robinhood app](https://robinhood.com/us/en/). As I started using it more, I wasn't really fond of the dull UI which wasn't really fun to interact with. After seeing several stock application projects on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) & [Behance](https://behance.net), I decided I wanted to create my own.

# Planning

First, I decided to make a list of things which I disliked about the [Robinhood app](https://robinhood.com/us/en/).

At first, I felt I was unsatisfied with the large & buly icons, which go against the minimal aesthetic of this application. To solve this, I decided to use [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com), which is a collection of beautiful open source minimalistic icons. I also disliked the positioning of some items in the app. For instance, in the homepage it currently shows your total investment & all the different stocks you've bought, along with your lists & collections. I think this could be better seperated into a seperate section, as it packs a bunch of essential information. I instead put recent stock market news articles in the homepage, giving the reader a quick insight about what's happening in the market. I also removed the messages feature & replaced it with a notifications section, because let's be honest - we don't need or want yet another inbox. The user profile has also been deprecated in this redesign, as I've put all the info it provided within the stocks section.

# User Interface

[Robinhood app](https://robinhood.com/us/en/) is an app which is designed to make investing easier for the average person, which is why a simple & accessible interface should be the top priority while designing it. Great UI/UX is about being clear, & I think the [Robinhood app](https://robinhood.com/us/en/) isn't up to mark on this sector. As mentioned above, [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/)'s main goal is to make the trade market more accessible for the average person, and the gamification of investing might have some unwanted consequences. To fix this, clear error messages & a well-written interface is really important. Along with this, I think making the app a convinent option for intermediate traders should also be a focus, & the app should have a dual focus on people of both skill levels. By default, the app should tell users the bare minimum they need to know & not overwhelm the users - although, if the users want more data & information, they shouldn't be refused.
