# The Idea

I was scrolling through my YouTube feed, where I found a new [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIjZSJB1uyc&t=1059s) by one of my favourite design channels, [Cuberto](https://www.youtube.com/c/CubertoDesign). It was on preparing design portfolios on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/harshhhdev), where it showed their step-by-step process of their [McDonald's Kiosk Redesign](https://www.behance.net/gallery/84835219/McDonalds-Kiosk-Redesign). I really enjoyed the video, and afterwards I decided I wanted to create something similar. Coincidentally, I was planning on buying new sneakers at the time, and I decided to pick the [Nike mobile app](https://www.nike.com/nike-app) to redesign.

# Planning

First, I downloaded the [Nike iOS app](https://www.nike.com/nike-app) on my iPhone, and played around with it a bit. The app was simple, & got the job done. But it felt lifeless and boring to interact with. The colours were bland, and my engagement was in general pretty low.

I decided to make visuals the main aspects of the design. I wanted to create fresh & interesting visuals for users, with unique colours and fluid layouts, & remove the boring look of it.

# User Interface

This application is targeted at a wide audience, ranging from people in their teens (like me) to 40 & 50 year olds. Due to it's relatively young audience, I decided I could ease accessibility rules a little in my design, & experiment around more with shadows, gradients, etc.

I decided to create both a light & dim-ish dark mode, as many people (including me) don't like looking at bright things for long periods of time, especially at night.

For the font, I decided to go with [Averta](https://thedesignersfoundry.com/averta), by [T:D:F](https://thedesignersfoundry.com/). It closely resembles [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/), which is one the most readable fonts along with being of my favourites.  

I really love [Averta](https://thedesignersfoundry.com/averta). It has a geometrical, simple yet appealing look which just blends in perfectly with (almost) anything. They characters are drawn to perfect sizes, and are coherent to read & look at.
