One thing I've seen across many designer/design studio websites are a cool custom cursor in place of your default computer one. Recently, I added one to my [website](https://harshhhdev.github.io) aswell.

I had to write one from scratch (using some internet resources of course!), since all the NPM libraries I found were either outdated, or didn't support SSR.

After adding the cursor to my own website, I had an idea to create an NPM package for it for a while. This weekend, I had some freetime from school and got to work!

This library supports [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), along with server-side rendering ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Remix](https://remix.run))

Want a demo? I setup a quick [demo website](https://harshhhdev.github.io/custom-pointer-react/) to help you tweak and experiment around with values!

## 🚀 Setup

To download the library, head over to your terminal:

```bash:terminal
yarn add custom-pointer-react
```

Next, import the cursor component into your file and customise it! Don't forget to wrap your app in the context afterwards.

```tsx:tsx
import { Cursor } from 'custom-pointer-react'
...
const Cursor = () => {
  return (
    ...
    <Cursor {...passParametersToCustomise} />
    ...
  )
}
...
export default App
```

All parameters are optional, and here's a list of the different parameters which you can customise:

| Parameter  | Description                                         | Default |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| color      | The background colour of the cursor                 | #000000 |
| showRing   | Controls whether to show the ring around the cursor | true    |
| ringSize   | Controls the size of the ring around the cursor     | 50px    |
| cursorSize | Controls the size of the cursor                     | 10px    |
| ringBorder | Controls the width of the ring's border             | 2px     |

Now, go into your app and import the MouseContext provider.

```tsx:pages/_app.tsx
import { MouseContextProvider } from 'custom-pointer-react'
...
ReactDOM.render(
  <MouseContextProvider>
    <App />
  </MouseContextProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
...
```

Your custom cursor should be good to go!

## Conclusion

That's all for today. I just wanted to quickly show off this new React library I created.

What're your thoughts on custom cursors? Personally, I think they can hinder accessibility, so you should try to use them carefully. They'd be a perfect fit for your designer or agency home page though!

Anyways, that sums up today's post. Until next time. 👋
