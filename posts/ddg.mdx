[DuckDuckGo]: it's my personal favorite search engine, and has grown to more and more popularity over the past few years. It has a squeaky clean reputation when it comes to privacy, as it _claims_ to not sell your data. Alongside it's open-source and community driven.

Here are a list of some easter eggs, fun, and silly [DuckDuckGo] tricks/tips.

## **Tips/tricks**

A few awesome tips and tricks to either try out something silly, or to make your life easier.

### Bangs

...and so on, so forth. For a list of all all of these 'bangs', check out [duckduckgo.com/bang](https://duckduckgo.com/bang).

### Social Media

Just type in '@'' infront of a user or organization, and watch the [magic].

### Generate passwords

Type in 'password [number]', and it will automatically generate a secure password for you.

### Cheatsheets

Adding 'cheatsheet' at the end of your search to pull up a [cheatsheet].

### Searching for any calendar

Typing in 'calendar' will bring up a simple, boring calendar. Though [DuckDuckGo] can do so much more. Type in calendar followed by the date (eg. 17 August 1345) and it will pull up a calendar from [then].

### Generate QR Codes

Add 'qr' and then a link will generate a [QR code].

### Find HTML codes

Typing in ['HTML chars'] will bring up HTML codes for special characters.

### Find color codes

Type in ['color codes'].

## Find certain colors
