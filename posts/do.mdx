So, recently [DigitalOcean App Platform Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-digitalocean-app-platform-hackathon-on-dev-2i1k) was just announced on Dev.

I thought I'd put together this list of things of which I think will be helpful resources for anybody partaking in this.

## Background

DigitalOcean App Platform Hackathon starts on December 10, 2020 and ends January 10, 2021. You'll have a chance to win some cool prizes for building an application using DigitalOcean's new App Platform.

There are for categories, which are

- Personal Site/Portfolio
- Build an application related to mental health.
- Build something that could become commercial and earn big bucks
- Build a wacky app that doesn't fit into any of the categories above.

You can view the full post with the rules of the Hackathon and other useful info on the [announcement post](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-digitalocean-app-platform-hackathon-on-dev-2i1k).
