---

As this year has come to an end, I thought I'd take a moment to reflect on the past year of my life. It was an year full of learning, growing, and sharing. Looking back over the past year, I'm able to remind myself of the challenges I faced, remember what I've learned, how I've grown, see what I've accomplished, and most importantly think about what I need to do this year in order to further facilitate this growth.

This recap isn't just limited to things related to technology, but needless to say technology makes up a major chunk of this blog post.

## Conclusion

That's about all I have to share for my year. Through many highs and lows, this year was filled with memories I hope to cherish one day. I try to write a post similar to this annually to retrospect how I've grown.

I'll end this post off with a quote by Ferris Bueller.

> "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."

Wishing y'all the best of luck for the upcoming year. Cheers.
